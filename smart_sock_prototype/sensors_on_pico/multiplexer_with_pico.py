#For the code example I just took the binary table, made it into a simple array, and put it in a function that does this: You give the function a number 0-15. It looks up that number in the binary array, then it loops through those 4 numbers and sets S0, S1, S2, and S3 appropriately. (In the arduino software HIGH is the same as1 & LOW is the same as 0). After it sets the pins so that SIG is connected to the correct channel, it then reads analog 0 (where SIG is connected to) and returns that value. So all you need to do is something like this

#switch mux to channel 15 and read the value
#  int val = readMux(15);

s0 = Pin(0, Pin.OUT)
s1 = Pin(1, Pin.OUT)
s2 = Pin(2, Pin.OUT)
